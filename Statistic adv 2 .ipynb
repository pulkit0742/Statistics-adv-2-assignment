It involves formulating a null hypothesis (a statement of no effect or no difference) and an alternative hypothesis (a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis). Then, statistical tests are performed on the sample data to assess the likelihood of observing the data if the null hypothesis were true. Based on the results of these tests, you either reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n","\n","\n","      \n","             \n"],"metadata":{"id":"wZ7asXXs1k5G"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Q2: What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative\n","hypothesis?\n","\n","#Answer:\n","\n"," The null hypothesis ($H_0$$H_0$) is a statement of no effect, no difference, or no relationship. It represents the status quo or a commonly accepted belief. The alternative hypothesis ($H_1$$H_1$ or $H_a$$H_a$) is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It proposes that there is a significant effect, difference, or relationship. The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4d-iHTs-2Qza"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Q3: Explain the significance level in hypothesis testing and its role in deciding the outcome of a test?\n","\n"," #Answer:\n","\n","  The significance level, denoted by alpha ($\\alpha$$\\alpha$), is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. It represents the maximum risk of making a Type I error (false positive) that you are willing to accept. Commonly used significance levels are 0.05 (5%), 0.01 (1%), and 0.10 (10%). The significance level plays a crucial role in deciding the outcome of a test. If the p-value (the probability of observing the sample data, or more extreme data, if the null hypothesis were true) is less than or equal to the significance level, you reject the null hypothesis.
